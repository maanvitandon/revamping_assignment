# revamping_assignment
Revamped a given website to a new theme.

This was an assignment to revamp a website of a company to their new theme with the same contents and design. The bootsrap files for the new theme was given to revamp.
The css\custom.css file and the index file was created by me to re-design the website as per the given theme and my aesthetic choices.

The original website given can be seen by- https://mywanderlust.in/experience/139/nag-tibba-trek/
The revamped website I created can be accessed by- https://maanvitandon.github.io/revamping_assignment/

This is just an attempt to revamping a website. The code for this assignment still needs updates and additions.
